 RayMunozFintech
My name is Raymundo Munoz, but everyone calls me Ray. I have no background in coding and developing other than some very intro java.

My career goal is to become a data analyst or be able to become a blockchain developer. 

I chose Fintech as my career path because of all the potentials.
